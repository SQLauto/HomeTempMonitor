Basic web page used to read my private SQL Server database to show temperatures on a graph using the Google charting tools. Both desktop and mobile versions are present. I created a separate mobile version simply as a learning tool and I only have an iPhone and iPad that access this page. I will probably convert it to use Bootstrap and move away from using tables.

Temperature data is collected from a Raspberry Pi with a Dallas DS18B20 sensor.

Future updates are to include adding an external temperature sensor to the Raspberry Pi and to integrate the desktop and mobile pages.
